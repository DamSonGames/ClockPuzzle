# ClockPuzzle
An attempt at a puzzle game that turned out to be too easy.

Welcome to Clock Puzzle.

This is an attempt at a puzzle game which failed due to the nature of the puzzle, which makes you unable to fail.
It was made in about an hour or two. Let's just say it's for testing.
This is a test for minimalizing code, as it uses 21 lines of JavaScript, unfortunately there is a lot more CSS.
Click a red button to rotate the four clocks around it.
Open Home.html to play.

Have fun!
